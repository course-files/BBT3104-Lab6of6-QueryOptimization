## Internet Movie Database (IMDb)

IMDb captures more than 2.5 million movie titles produced over 133 years by 234,997 different companies with over 4 million actors. It subsequently contains many **join-crossing correlations** thus making it challenging for cardinality estimators. This is unlike TPC-H and TPC-DS which are considered trivial for cardinality estimators.

* **Recommended:** The version of IMDb used in Leis et al. (2018) can be downloaded from here: [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/job/imdb.tgz](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/job/imdb.tgz). This version was created in May 2013.

* The current version of IMDb can be
downloaded from here: [http://www.imdb.com/interfaces](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces)

## Data Import

1. Create the PostgreSQL Docker container using [Docker-Compose.yaml](/Docker-Compose.yaml)

2. Create the IMDb database in Postgres using [schema.sql](Internet-Movie-Database--IMBDb/schema.sql)

3. Download the `.tgz` file, decompress it, and import each `.csv` file into its respective table. You can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) (recommended) or any other similar database tool when importing. A slightly similar video tutorial is available [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/PKpzDL-yRPw?si=Y32Hqp3k0ZO9Kwm7).<br> Alternatively, you can use [cinemagoer](https://pypi.org/project/cinemagoer/), formerly [IMDbPy](https://pypi.org/project/IMDbPY/), to automate this step.

## Join Order Benchmark (JOB) queries

4. Proceed to execute the Join Order Benchmark (JOB) queries available [here](/Join-Order-Benchmark-queries) on the IMDb database in PostgreSQL.

## Q-Error Calculations

5. Execute the q-error computation code to quantitatively determine the error between the actual cardinality and the estimated cardinality per node for each query [here](q-error/cardinality-based-q-error-per-node-using-yaml.py).
